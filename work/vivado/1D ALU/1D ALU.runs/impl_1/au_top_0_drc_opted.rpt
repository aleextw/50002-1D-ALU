2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP sixteen_bit_alu/mlt/p0 input sixteen_bit_alu/mlt/p0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP sixteen_bit_alu/mlt/p0 input sixteen_bit_alu/mlt/p0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP sixteen_bit_alu/mlt/p0 output sixteen_bit_alu/mlt/p0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP sixteen_bit_alu/mlt/p0 multiplier stage sixteen_bit_alu/mlt/p0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT btn_cnd/M_ctr_q[27]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 28 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
sel/M_ctr_q_reg[0], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[10], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[11], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[12], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[13], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[14], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[15], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[16], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[17], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[18], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[19], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[1], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[20], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[21], sel/M_ctr_q_reg[22] (the first 15 of 28 listed)
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT sel/M_a_dff_q[15]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
M_a_dff_q_reg[0], M_a_dff_q_reg[10], M_a_dff_q_reg[11], M_a_dff_q_reg[12], M_a_dff_q_reg[13], M_a_dff_q_reg[14], M_a_dff_q_reg[15], M_a_dff_q_reg[1], M_a_dff_q_reg[2], M_a_dff_q_reg[3], M_a_dff_q_reg[4], M_a_dff_q_reg[5], M_a_dff_q_reg[6], M_a_dff_q_reg[7], M_a_dff_q_reg[8] (the first 15 of 16 listed)
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT sel/M_alufn_dff_q[5]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 5 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
M_alufn_dff_q_reg[0], M_alufn_dff_q_reg[1], M_alufn_dff_q_reg[2], M_alufn_dff_q_reg[4], M_alufn_dff_q_reg[5]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT sel/M_b_dff_q[15]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
M_b_dff_q_reg[0], M_b_dff_q_reg[10], M_b_dff_q_reg[11], M_b_dff_q_reg[12], M_b_dff_q_reg[13], M_b_dff_q_reg[14], M_b_dff_q_reg[15], M_b_dff_q_reg[1], M_b_dff_q_reg[2], M_b_dff_q_reg[3], M_b_dff_q_reg[4], M_b_dff_q_reg[5], M_b_dff_q_reg[6], M_b_dff_q_reg[7], M_b_dff_q_reg[8] (the first 15 of 16 listed)
Related violations: <none>
